📚 Lecture 1: Introduction to Java & OOP

1️⃣ What is Java?
💡 Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language.
	(*) High-level → Easy to read and write.
	(*) Object-Oriented → Uses objects to structure programs.
	(*) Platform-Independent → Runs on any system (Windows, Mac, Linux) using JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

2) How Java Works?
	1: Write the code → .java file.
	2: Compile it → Converts to bytecode (.class file).
	3: Run it → JVM executes the program.

4) Writing Your First Java Program
🖥️ Simple Java Program to Print a Message
// Importing Scanner for user input (we will use this later)
import java.util.Scanner;  

// Class definition
public class FirstProgram {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        System.out.println("Hello, Maria! Welcome to Java Programming.");  
    }  
}

4️⃣ Explanation of Code
	1: public class FirstProgram { } → Defines a class (every Java program needs a class).
	2: public static void main(String[] args) { } → Main method (program execution starts here).
	3: System.out.println("Hello, Maria!"); → Prints a message on the screen.

📝 Notes for Lecture 1
	=> Java is object-oriented, high-level, and platform-independent.
	=> JVM (Java Virtual Machine) allows Java to run anywhere.
 	=> Every Java program starts with a class and a main method.
